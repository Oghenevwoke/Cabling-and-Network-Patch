# Cabling-and-Network-Patch


<h2>Description</h2>
This Project shows steps taken to troubleshoot a device with DHCP issues, not connecting to the client internal server. Not only so, but also shows power of collaboration and communication across different stakeholders, support level, proper troubleshooting steps as well as procurement of new device and returns.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Network Tester</b> 
- <b>Cable Tester</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Switches</b>
- <b>Wall Jack</b>
- Network Cables
- Patch Panel
- Network Rack
- Dell PC(Windows 11)

<h2> Troubleshooting Steps </h2>

1. Network Cable Check: I verified that the network cables from the wall jack to the computer were functioning properly.

2. Port Check: I checked the ports from the wall jack to the patch panel and switch, and received a feedback when scanning, indicating that the ports were good.

3. Remote Support: I contacted Remote support, which connected me with XXX at Clients internal Remote Support. XXX was updated on the steps taken so far.



<h2> Collaborative Troubleshooting with XXX: </h2>



1. Port Bouncing: XXX performed a full bounce on SwA port 10 and SwB port 10.

2. Port Migration: We migrated the cable to different ports to check for any issues, but were unable to establish a connection.

3. Wall Jack Port Change: We moved from port 6D1 to 6D2 on the wall jack, which resulted in a red network link light. The cable is currently staged on 6D2, Switch B port 10.



<h2> Findings and Recommendations: </h2>

Further troubleshooting revealed the following issues:

1. Improper PC Naming: The PC was not named properly on the drive.

2. Auto-Login: The PC logged in directly without prompting for a password on restart or shut down.

3. Ping Test: XXX was unable to ping the PC through its IP.

Based on these findings, it was determined that the hard drive needs to be returned to MOD for re-staging. A new hard drive with the same computer name and proper staging is required.

<h2> Additional Observations: </h2>

I noticed that the PC had been changed within 4 days of working on it, which may be relevant to the issues encountered.

<h2> Next Steps: </h2>
As resolved my myself and Remote Support, XXX will need to send a new hard drive with the properly staged PC, and further testing will be required to ensure the issue is resolved.
